Brief Introduction
------------------

Mistify  (/mistify/) is a library for building neurofuzzy systems and fuzzy neural networks.

It is built using PyTorch to allow for easy integration into systems you have built. 

Example
-------

Hereâ€™s an example of a fuzzy system. 


What does it have to offer?
---------------------------

Mistify offers a variety of tools to help develop complete neurofuzzy systems as well as integrate them into other architectures.


Next Steps
