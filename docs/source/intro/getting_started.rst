Brief Introduction
------------------

Mistify  (/mistify/) is a library for building neurofuzzy systems and fuzzy neural networks.

It is built using PyTorch to allow for easy integration into systems you have built. 

Example
-------

Hereâ€™s an example of a learning machine. The first layer of the network consists of decision trees (instead of a concatenation of dot product operations). The second layer then uses typical matrix multiplication to obtain the output


What does it have to offer?
---------------------------

Mistify offers a variety of tools to help develop complete neurofuzzy systems as well as integrate them into other architectures.


Next Steps
----------

The next step is to install Mistify. The main requirements are to have Pytorch, Numpy, and Pandas installed.
